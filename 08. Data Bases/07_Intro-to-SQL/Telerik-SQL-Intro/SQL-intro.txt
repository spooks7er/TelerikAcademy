SQL is a laguage that lets us manipulate data and database objects 
in a relational database system

DML - Data Manipulation language is that part of the SQL languange
with which we manipulate the data (duh!). It gives us commands like 
SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.

DDL - Data Definition Language. Gives us the tools to manipulate database 
objects like tables, keys, triggers and so on. The most important DDL 
commands are CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE.

T-SQL - Transact SQL is an extension to SQL that allows us to do more 
in depth programming with SQL like creating loops, iterations, 
conditional structures and so on.
