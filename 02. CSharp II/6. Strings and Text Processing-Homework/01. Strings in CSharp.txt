Problem 1. Strings in C#.• Describe the strings in C#.
• What is typical for the string data type?
• Describe the most important methods of the String class.

The string is data type is a collection of characters, that has a fixed length
and indexing like with and array. The string data type is immutable. 
This means that it is read only, and to change a string .Net creates
a new copy of the current stringwith the new changes. This can lead 
to fill up the memory quickly when working with big operations. 
To avoid that we use the StringBuilder.

Most important methods of the String class:

str.Lengtg - returns the lenght of the string;
Compare(str1, str2) - Compares two strings using the ascii table;
str1.IndexOf(str2) - Returns the first occurance of a given string or char in another string;
str1.LastIndexOf(str2) - Returns the last occurance of a given string or char in another string;
str.Substring(1, 5) - Returns a part of a string starting from a given imdex (1), 
					   that a has a specified length (5);
str.Replace(old, new) - Replaces a given part of the string with a new one;
str.Remove(1, 5) - Works like Substring(), but instead of returning the specified idexes 
				   it removes them and returns the rest;
str.ToUpper() - Raises all letters in a string to upper case;
str.ToLower() - Lowers all letters in a string to lower case;
str.Trim() - Removes all whitespaces, tabulations, new lines and other characters if specified 
			 before and after the string.
