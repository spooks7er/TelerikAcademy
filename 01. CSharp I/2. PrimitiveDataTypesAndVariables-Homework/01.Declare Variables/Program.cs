//Problem 1. Declare Variables
//• Declare five variables choosing for each of them the most 
//appropriate of the types  byte, sbyte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, ulong  
//to represent the following values:  52130, -115, 4825932, 97, -10000 .
//• Choose a large enough type for each number to ensure it will fit in it. 
//Try to compile the code.
